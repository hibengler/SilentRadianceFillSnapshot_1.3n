Where:
old/current states "old" if this frame was effectively in the past, or "current" when the frame is now.
             missed packets, or too much computing might be why there are old packets.
	     If a packet is old, the next four packets have no value (set to 0)

	     



frame_no is the frame number from the server.


ctime_sec is the current time in seconds, from the clients point of view.
ctime_usec is the current time in microseconds, from the clients point of view.
beat_interval_in_milliseconds the interval of each beat in milliseconds. Can be used to get tempo.
where_in_tempo is the approximate point (from 0 to 1) where the music is in the tempo.
commanded_background_color - this is the background color that the DJ has set - usually 000000
pitch - the general pitch of the sample - in cycles per second.
microseconds - I think this is the time in microseconds with seconds added. This is from the server.
db_level - decibel level of the music.
folded_flags - these are flags of the last fur flag sections all ored together.  Helps find beat onset and tempo better.
has_beat - set to 2 if there is a tempo beat
has_onset - set to 1 if there is a beat onset.
pitch_rgb_value - hex rgb value determined by the pitch
