The idea is to show a map of the world where the ip addresses are. So it is a cool listener database.

So - would select the latest from the database, use that data, and place poins on a map
I want it in gif format, so it can be the background or something.


First - need location from ip address:
https://lite.ip2location.com/database/ip-country-region-city-latitude-longitude
https://lite.ip2location.com/download?id=6
IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB5.BIN.ZIP





 unzip *.ZIP
 
 
3. Licensees may copy, distribute, display and perform the work and make derivat
ive works based on IP2Location LITE only if they give the IP2LOCATION.COM credit
